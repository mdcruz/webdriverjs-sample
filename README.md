# Selenium Webdriver (JS) example test

This is a repo containing a sample test using vanilla Selenium Webdriver JS. This just automates a simple Todo app where a todo item is added to the list and marked as completed.

## Install dependencies

Run `npm i` to install project dependencies

## Downloading ChromeDriver

If you wish to run the tests locally, you would need to download ChromeDriver for this example. The ChromeDriver version will depend on what Chrome version you are using. More information [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads).

Once you have downloaded the correct chromedriver version, you need to export this in your PATH variable.

## Running test

Run `npm test` to run the sample test
